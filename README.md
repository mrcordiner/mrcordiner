I have presented frequently at conferences and workshops in these areas.



My foci in the classroom are teaching programming, problem solving, making and the design process.

I teach my classes using a variety of techniques including project and enquiry based learning, differentiated instruction and blended learning. I believe in learning-by-doing and building up from first principles (as best as can be done).

I strive to teach equitably to a diverse set of students.
